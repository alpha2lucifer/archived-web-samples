   <h1>ABOUT</h1>
   <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.</p>

   <h1>SOME COOL FACTS!!!</h1> 
   <ul>
   <li>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</li> 
   <li>Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.</li>
   <li>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</li>
   <li>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</li>
   <li>Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.</li>

   <h1>POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
   <ul>
   <li></li> 
   <li>Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.

It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney.</li>
   <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 

Unlike a scripting or programming language that uses scripts to perform functions, a markup language uses tags to identify content.</li>
   <li>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a free, highly popular, open source scripting language. PHP scripts are executed on the server.

Just a short list of what PHP is capable of:
- Generating dynamic page content
- Creating, opening, reading, writing, deleting, and closing files on the server
- Collecting form data
- Adding, deleting, and modifying information stored in your database
- controlling user-access
- encrypting data
- and much more!</li>
   <li>C# is an elegant object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework. 
You can use C# to create Windows applications, Web services, mobile applications, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more.</li>
   <li>Java is a high level, modern programming language designed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, and currently owned by Oracle. 

Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!
Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application.</li>
   <li>C++ is a popular cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications - operating systems, browsers, video-games, art applications and so on.</li>
